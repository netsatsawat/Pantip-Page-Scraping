# Pantip Page Scraping 
## Note: The script is still in development phase...

Pantip is probably, if not, one of the most famous community/webboard in Thailand. Also the webboard is categorised in multiple categories, which in part the topics in this website can be reflected towards Thai people (or can be Thai society).

The purpose of the script is to gather the data related to topic of discussion, time of post, and the tag for semantic analysis, or deeper dive to see the trends and patterns in the forum.
